### [A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/)

Security misconfiguration is when computer systems or applications are set up in a way that makes them vulnerable to attacks. This can happen if the security settings are not properly done, such as having weak passwords, leaving unnecessary features enabled, or not updating software regularly.

Based on that article, it was found that about 90% of applications were tested for these misconfigurations, and over 208,000 instances of such vulnerabilities were identified. Common issues include not securing parts of the application, using default passwords, and revealing too much information when errors occur.

To prevent these problems, it's important to follow secure installation processes. This includes making sure all environments (like development and production) are configured the same way with strong security measures. Unnecessary features should be removed, and regular reviews and updates should be done to keep everything secure. Additionally, it's crucial to check and secure cloud storage permissions.

For example, an attacker could take advantage of misconfigurations to compromise a server, access sensitive information, or exploit vulnerabilities. To stay safe, it's essential to have a repeatable and automated process for setting up and maintaining secure configurations.
